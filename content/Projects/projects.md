## BUSINESS ANALYSIS
##### Best Products/Services
The Sony Group Corporation was founded in 1946 in Japan, and its IPO date was September 1970. The company trades in the New York Stock Exchange, under the stock ticker SONY, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Sony is a recognizable company that has brought many products to fame here in the US, from the introduction of the Walkman back in the 80s to the release of the PlayStation 5 last year. Sony has been a namesake in this country for quite some time now. Some of its best products/services include:
+ PlayStation
+ Sony Pictures
+ Sony TV’s  

Sony with its PlayStation division is leading in the video game industry. With the launch of its new console, the PlayStation 5 (PS5), Sony is breaking record sales in the industry. In July 2021, it was reported that PS5 sold more than 10 million units since its launch in November 2020 (Good 2021). Nintendo is also making great strides in the video game industry. They have bounced back from the failure of the Wii U that released back in 2012. With the release of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo month after month had been dominating the sales charts making it a clear competitor to Sony. The Switch had been the most sold console for 33 months up until the PS5 took the spot in September (Tassi 2021). However, the internal power of the Nintendo Switch does not match up with the internal power of the PS5. The PS5 can run games at a native 4K resolution whereas the Nintendo Switch can run those games at a resolution of either 1080p or 720p. There is a clear gap in the power of these consoles.  
Sony Pictures is positioned well in the movie industry. It released Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse in 2018 and garnered a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with an audience score of 93%. With the upcoming release of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which is sure to be big at the box office, Sony Pictures has great projects coming up. Disney is most definitely the biggest competitor Sony Pictures has. Disney has the rights to make Marvel, and Star Wars movies. These two franchises bring a lot of popularity among nerd culture. Disney has been on fire with its Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The fact that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse can do very well without the help from Disney by being related to the MCU shows that Sony Pictures can put up a fight in the movie industry. 
Sony TVs are some of the best televisions to buy. TechRadar, a website dedicated to buying guides for technology, put Sony’s A90J OLED TV in the top ten of TVs to buy for 2021. Sony’s televisions always seem to be highly regarded for their picture quality only downside is their price. Samsung is one of Sony’s biggest competitors in TV manufacturing. Samsung TVs are often on top ten TV charts together with Sony TVs and are looked at as quality TVs. However, in most rankings, Sony TVs chart higher than Samsung TVs. Sony TVs internal machinery are always being improved upon and are often highly regarded. They have the possibility to continue being one of the top TVs money can buy.  

##### Value Drivers
Assets are key factor in determining the value of a firm. They represent an economic resource that can be used to generate cash flow now or in the future. There are varying types of assets that a company can have. Assets can be found in the balance sheet of a company. 

**Table 1:**  
Balance Sheet *– Currency in JPY. All numbers in thousands*  
![Assets](/images/Assets.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)  
As seen in Table 1, from 2019 to 2020, Sony had an increase of 10% in total assets, and, from 2020 to 2021, an increase of 14% in total assets. Current assets and non-current assets also saw an increase year over year.   

**Table 2:**  
Balance Sheet Items (in %)  
![Balance Sheet Items](/images/balancesheet-items.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)    
As one can see from Table 2, other long-term assets and total current assets are what make up most of the total assets for Sony. In 2021, other long-term assets make up about 61% and total current assets make up about 27%. Other long-term assets have been decreasing year-over-year, whereas total current assets have been increasing year-over-year. Even though other long-term assets have been decreasing, it still makes up most of the assets for Sony.  

Cash Flow is another factor for the valuation of a firm. It is the flow of money in a company. Positive cash flow suggests that a company’s liquid assets are increasing, and negative cash flow suggests that a company’s liquid assets are decreasing. Having a positive cash flow is important because it allows the company to return money to shareholders, invest in other companies, settle debts, and pay expenses.

**Table 3:**

![Cash Flow](/images/CashFlows.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)  
As one can see in Table 3, Sony’s free cash flows have been positive for the last three years. However, free cash flows have been declining year-over-year.   

The last factor for the valuation of a firm is growth options. Growth options can be seen as something that a company may plan to have or plan to invest in. Growth options can also be something that a company plans to launch and nurture in the future. In general, some useful examples of growth options are new products, new markets, global expansion, acquisitions, R&D, etc. We can also look at the firm’s growth rate. For instance, according to Yahoo! Finance Sony has a five-year growth rate of 11.6%, as forecasted by analysts. Sony has also substantially increased its R&D investment from 18.1 billion yen to 499.3 billion yen. Sony has a plethora of items culminating that add to their growth options. The PSVR 2 is a new VR headset currently in development at PlayStation rumored to release either late next year or early 2023 (Hood 2021). Sony has also been acquiring game studios to build their PlayStation brand (Housemarque, Firesprite, Nixxes Software, and Bluepoint Games). These game studios are all currently developing new products (Barker 2021). Also, PlayStation Head of Worldwide Studios, Herman Hulst has also gone on record to say that they are also looking to acquire other developers (Dornbush 2021). PS5 Pro, an updated version of the PS5, rumored to be in development with a release in late 2023 (Grunin 2021). Sony also will have a new line of Bravia TVs. Sony comes out with a new line of Bravia TVs every year.

**Sustainable Growth Rate**  
All of my information was gathered from Sony’s statistics page on Yahoo! Finance. Sony’s sustainable growth rate was calculated as follows. 
Payout Ratio = 3.99%		Return on Equity = 15.62% 
Sustainable Growth Rate = Plowback ratio * Return on Equity
> Sustainable Growth Rate = (1 – Payout ratio) * Return on Equity  
> = (1 – 0.0399) * 0.1562  
> = 0.9601 * 0.1562  
> = 15.00%  

Sony grows at a rate of 15% with external financing, but without the need of additional equity issues. If the company would like to grow beyond its current SGR threshold, then it will need to issue more stocks and leverage bond issues. 

## Financial Analysis

##### Financial Ratio Analyses
1. Market Cap
    > For **SONY** (as of Nov. 5)          
    **Market Cap = 143.24B**  

    > Comparible Firms (all sources from Yahoo Finance):  
    **Panasonic: 28.573B  
    Samsung: 402.315B  
    Nintendo: 53.115B**  
    Note: Panasonic, Samsung, and Nintendo sell similar products as Sony making them the right competitors for my analysis.  

Interpretation:
Sony is a Large-Cap firm because its market cap is higher than $10B. All of the comparable firms are also Large-Cap market firms indicating that they are also mature firms.

2. Leverage Ratio
    >  For **SONY** (fiscal year 2020):  
    > **Leverage Ratio**  
    = Long-term Debt/ (Long-term Debt + Equity)   
    = 634,966,000 / (634,966,000 + 4,125,306,000)   
    = **13.34%**   

    > Comparable Firms:  
    **Panasonic: Leverage Ratio**  
    = 953,831,000 / (953,831,000 + 1,998,349,000)  
    = **32.31%**  
    **Samsung: Leverage Ratio**  
    = 2,947,853,000 / (2,947,853,000 + 267,670,331,000)  
    = **1.09%**  
    **Nintendo: Leverage Ratio**  
    ***Nintendo has not reported any long term debt in the last five years according to both Morningstar and Yahoo Finance. Therefore, Leverage ratio is zero for Nintendo.***  

Interpretation:
- Step (1) Sony’s leverage ratio is less than the average leverage ratio of 20-30%, which signals that it does not have high risk of financial distress. It also is less than the critical value of 40%, which shows that it is not at risk of financial distress.
- Step (2) Sony has the second lowest leverage ratio. All, except Nintendo, have a leverage ratio that is less than the critical value of 40%. Nintendo has no debt ratio which is most likely because it is in the tech industry.
3. Current Ratio
    > For **SONY** (fiscal year 2020):  
    **Current Ratio = 0.92**  

    > Comparable Firms:  
    **Panasonic: Current Ratio = 1.31  
    Samsung: Current Ratio = 2.62  
    Nintendo: Current Ratio = 4.22**

Interpretations:
-	Step (1) Sony’s current ratio is below the average current ratio of US firms (2–2.5). Sony’s current ratio is below the critical threshold of 1 to 1.25, which suggests that the company is at risk of financial distress and has a short-term liquidity problem
-	Step (2) Sony’s liquidity is lower than is competitors (Panasonic, Samsung, Nintendo).

4. Asset Turnover
    > For **SONY** (fiscal year 2020):  
    **Asset Turnover = 0.38**

    > Comparable Firms:  
    **Panasonic: Asset Turnover = 1.22  
    Samsung: Asset Turnover = 0.65  
    Nintendo: Asset Turnover = 0.72**  

Interpretations:
-	Step (1) Asset turnover has an average range of 0.5 to 2 with significant differences between different industries. Sony is below the average range. However, because asset turnover varies greatly between industries, it is best to compare Sony’s asset turnover to its competitors.
-	Step (2) Sony is less efficient than all of its competitors. Sony may have a low asset turnover because it is a very mature firm. Panasonic is the most efficient compared to Sony, Samsung, and Nintendo.

5. ROA 
    > For **SONY** (fiscal year 2020):  
    **ROA = 2.65%** 

    > Comparable Firms:  
    **Panasonic: ROA = 3.69%  
    Samsung: ROA = 7.14%  
    Nintendo: ROA = 14.27%**  

Interpretations:
-	Step (1) Sony’s ROA is significantly lower than the critical value of ROA of 9-10%. The result suggests no value creation to shareholders.
-	Step (2) Sony has a lower ROA than all of its competitors such as Panasonic, Samsung, and Nintendo.
 
6. ROE
    > For **SONY** (fiscal year 2020):  
    **ROE = 14.79%**  

    > Comparable Firms:  
    **Panasonic: ROE = 11.54%  
    Samsung: ROE = 9.99%  
    Nintendo: ROE = 17.53%**  

Interpretations:
-	Step (1) Sony’s ROE is higher than the critical value ROE of 10-11%, suggesting that it has value creation to equity investors and that it has good operating performance.
-	Step (2) Sony has the higher operating performance (ROE) compared to Panasonic and Samsung; however, Nintendo has the highest operating performance (ROE).

7. Payout Ratio
    > For **SONY** (fiscal year 2020):  
    **Payout Ratio = 7.7%**  

    > Comparable Firms:   
    **Panasonic: Payout Ratio = 24.3%    
    Samsung: Payout Ratio = 0%   
    Nintendo: Payout Ratio = 49.7%**  

Interpretations:
-	Step (1) Sony pays dividends, and its payout ratio is significantly lower than the average payout ratio of 30 to 40%. Dividends can reduce information asymmetry and agency problems. Also, dividends are affected by the maturity of the firm and affected by industry norms.  Firms with high risk and uncertainty can’t pay dividends.
-	Step (2) Panasonic and Nintendo paid dividends as well and are close to the average payout ratio of 30 to 40%, this suggests that dividends may be common in the technology industry. Samsung does not pay dividends.

8. Forward P/E
    > For **SONY** (as of Nov 5): 
    **Forward P/E = 21.74**
    
    > Comparable Firms:  
    **Panasonic: Forward P/E = 14.14  
    Samsung: Forward P/E = 9.44  
    Nintendo: Forward P/E = 12.33**  

Interpretations:
-	Step (1) Sony’s forward P/E is higher than the average P/E ratio of 13 to 15. However, it does not surpass the threshold of P/E > 40, suggesting that P/E can still be informative here.
-	Step (2) Sony’s forward P/E is greater than the P/E ratios of the comparable firms. Panasonic and Nintendo align with the average P/E ratio. Samsung’s P/E ratio is low.  


9. Price/Book Ratio	
    > For SONY (as of Nov 5): 
Price/Book Ratio = 2.37

    > Comparable Firms:  
**Panasonic: Price/Book Ratio = 1.24  
Samsung: Price/Book Ratio = 1.68  
Nintendo: Price/Book Ratio = 3.27**  

Interpretations: 
-	Step (1) Sony’s P/B is higher than the average P/B ratio of 1 to 1.5 of US firms. A high P/B usually suggests high growth opportunities. 
-	Step (2) Sony’s P/B ratio is higher than Panasonics and Samsung, whose P/B ratio meets the average ratio of US firms. Nintendo’s P/B ratio is higher than Sony’s. 

10. Institutional Ownership (% of Shares Held by Institutions)	
    > For **SONY**:  
    **Institutional Ownership = 8.04%**  

    > Comparable Firms:  
    **Panasonic: Institutional Ownership = 0.29%  
    Samsung: Institutional Ownership = 41.33%  
    Nintendo: Institutional Ownership = 0.98%**  

Interpretations:
-	Step (1) Sony has low institutional ownership when comparing it to the US average of institutional ownership, which is about 20 to 30%. The low institutional ownership suggests that there is little monitoring and corporate governance. The low institutional ownership is likely due to the unique ownership structure of Japanese firms. 
-	Step (2) Samsung has the highest amount of institutional ownership. Sony has a higher institutional ownership when comparing to Panasonic and Nintendo whose institutional ownership is close to none, which is similar to Sony because they are Japanese firms.

##### Capital Market Imperfections
Sony has a number of capital market imperfections. The main imperfections it suffers from is information asymmetry, corporate governance and control, taxes, and financial distress. For information asymmetry, Sony primarily focuses on consumer electronics and entertainment, but more so on the electronics. Sony is more embedded in the technology industry; therefore, it may have higher information asymmetry. Sony has patents and information of proprietary products that they do not want to be released to the public without their consent. “R&D costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, increased by 18.1 billion yen to 499.3 billion yen. The ratio of R&D costs to total revenue excluding Financial Services was 7.2% compared to 6.5% in the previous fiscal year” (derived from Form 20-F for Sony on sec.gov). Because they do have R&D investments, the amount of information asymmetry is increased. As for corporate control/governance, the low institutional ownership suggests that there is little monitoring and corporate governance. The low institutional ownership is likely due to the unique ownership structure of Japanese firms. When looking at the board of directors, the majority of them are independent directors. Independence of board of directors can be associated with better monitoring. However, the CFO and CEO both are in the board of directors, which can weaken governance. Luckily, neither are chairman of the board. As for taxes, Long-term debt can provide tax shields. As seen in Table 4, Sony has long-term debt therefore it has tax savings. As for financial distress, Sony’s current ratio is below the average current ratio of US firms (2–2.5). Sony’s current ratio is also below the critical threshold of 1 to 1.25, which suggests that the company is at risk of financial distress and has a short-term liquidity problem. 

## FIRM VALUATION WITH SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
##### Valuation Assumptions
Table 4: 
![Valuation Assumptions](/images/ValuationAssumptions.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)   
The sales growth rate is derived from Yahoo! Finance, and it is the analysts forecast for future 5-years sales growth. The sales growth rate shows how much year over year sales will increase. Long-term growth rate is based on security analysts’ forecasts. Beta indicates the stocks sensitivity. Stocks with betas greater than 1.0 tend to amplify the overall movements of the market. Stocks with betas between 0 and 1.0 tend to move in the same direction as the market, but not as far. The average stock has a beta of 1.0. MarketWatch states that Sony has a beta that is 0.85, which coincides with the stocks whose betas are between 0 and 1.0 illustrating that the stock price moves in the same direction as the market. For reduction in capital expenditure, if it is equal to 1, then that means that there would be no reduction in projected Capital Expenditures in the future. So, if it were to drop to 0.8, then the reduction in projected Capital Expenditures in the future will be 20%.

Table 5:  
![FCF Valuation](/images/FCF-Val.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)  
According to the valuation results of the stock price based on FCF, Sony’s stock is over-valued. However, the valuation result is fairly close to the current market price. It is within 5% of a difference indicating that shareholders should hold on to the stock and not sell it. 

Table 6:  
![EP Valuation](/images/EP-Val.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)  
According to the valuation results of the stock price based on EP, Sony’s stock is over-valued. This time the valuation result is drastically lower than the current market price indicating that shareholders should sell and not hold. 

Table 7:  
![RE Valuation](/images/RE-Val.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)  
According to the valuation results of the stock price based on RE, Sony’s stock is under-valued. RE valuation results show that the current market price is lower than it should be indicating that shareholders or stock traders should buy Sony stock.

Table 8:  
![Sensitivity Table in Sales Growth](/images/Sensitivity-Table.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)  
According to Table 8, as sales growth rate increases, firm value increases. When the firm’s sales growth rate increases from 12% to 20%, firm value increases by 60% from $118.74 to $189.61. This drastic increase in firm value indicates that the firm value is very sensitive to sales growth rate for Sony. If Sony does not maintain a sales growth rate at 12%, it can run the risk of their firm losing a great deal of value.  

Table 9:    
![Sensitivity Table in Beta](/images/Sensitivity-Table-beta.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)  
According to Table 9, as beta increases, firm value decreases because beta represents the risk of the firm. High risk would mean less firm value because of the high discount rate. When the firm’s beta increases from 0.85 to 1, firm value decreases by 12% from $118.74 to $104.18. 

Table 10:  
![Sensitivity Table in Cap Exp](/images/Sensitivity-Table-Cap-Exp.png?nf_resize=fit&w=300&h=400)  
According to Table 10, as capital expenditure decreases, firm value increases. When the firm’s capital expenditure decreases from 100% to 80%, firm value increases by 13% from 118.74 to 134.76. If Sony is able to lower costs down 20%, their firm value would increase by 13%.  

## POLICY ANALYSIS AND STOCK RECOMMENDATIONS
##### Corporate Financing and Capital Structure Decisions 
To figure out which external financing and capital structure decisions to recommend that enhance firm value, we have to look at the three Capital Structure Theories. The first theory is the Static Trade-off Theory. According to the Static Trade-off Theory, the firm should increase debt until the value from tax shields is just offset, at the margin, by increases in the costs of financial distress. Firms trade off corporate interest tax shields against the possible costs of financial distress due to borrowing. As one can see, the Static Trade-off Theory mainly focuses on financial distress. The second theory is the Pecking-Order Theory. The Pecking-Order Theory states that a firm should firstly finance itself internally through retained earnings, then borrow from debt market, or, as a last resort, issue equity. The theory primarily focuses on dealing with information asymmetry. The third theory is the Agency Theory. The Agency Theory involves using debt to prevent manager’s misuse of cash and reduce over-investment. Agency theory focuses on agency cost.

From these three theories, we can infer which would benefit Sony more to implement to enhance their firm value. The best solution is to do a combination of the Static Trade-off Theory and the Pecking-Order Theory. Sony is a mature firm, and it is stable and established enough to warrant the increase in debt to benefit from the tax shields. To use the Static Trade-off Theory, firms that do not show high risk of financial distress. As mentioned in the “Capital Market Imperfections” section, Sony does have a financial distress indicator in the current ratio. However, the current ratio is fairly close to 1, which is the minimum threshold for signs of financial distress. Sony’s leverage ratio being below the threshold and below the average also helps show that the company is not entirely at risk for financial distress. They can benefit from implementing the Static Trade-off Theory. Sony also suffers from information asymmetry. Sony is in the tech industry and is heavily investing in R&D, both of which lead to information asymmetry. If company shows concerns of information asymmetry, then the firm should use the Pecking-Order Theory. Sony should increase their internal financing to minimize information asymmetry, and, if they do not have enough internal funds, they can issue risk-free debt. Sony does not have to use the Agency Theory because they have little to no agency costs or problems.

##### Corporate Governance
Sony should continue to pay dividends. Paying dividends helps minimize asymmetric information and signals that their dividends are “costly and credible”. Not only that, but dividends can also help reduce agency cost of free cash flow and provides implicit monitoring. Sony should find a way to remove the CEO and the CFO out of the board of directors to increase the independence of the board of directors. Independence of board of directors can be associated with better monitoring.
## CONCLUSION
##### Stock Recommendations
After completing the financial analysis of Sony, people should buy Sony stock because of their forward P/E ratio, their P/B ratio, beta, and their valuation results of retained earnings. Because Sony’s P/E ratio is high and does not exceed the threshold and their P/B ratio is also higher than average, Sony may have higher growth opportunities, lower risk, or higher relative market valuation. This signals to me that this is a stock worth buying. Because their beta is below 1, Sony’s stock is less risky than the overall market making it safe to buy. The valuation results of the retained earnings shows that Sony’s stock is undervalued and should be bought. Those who already own Sony stock should continue to hold because of the FCF valuations.
