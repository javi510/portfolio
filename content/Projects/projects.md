## BUSINESS ANALYSIS
##### Best Products/Services
The Sony Group Corporation was founded in 1946 in Japan, and its IPO date was September 1970. The company trades in the New York Stock Exchange, under the stock ticker SONY, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Sony is a recognizable company that has brought many products to fame here in the US, from the introduction of the Walkman back in the 80s to the release of the PlayStation 5 last year. Sony has been a namesake in this country for quite some time now. Some of its best products/services include:
+ PlayStation
+ Sony Pictures
+ Sony TV’s  

Sony with its PlayStation division is leading in the video game industry. With the launch of its new console, the PlayStation 5 (PS5), Sony is breaking record sales in the industry. In July 2021, it was reported that PS5 sold more than 10 million units since its launch in November 2020 (Good 2021). Nintendo is also making great strides in the video game industry. They have bounced back from the failure of the Wii U that released back in 2012. With the release of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo month after month had been dominating the sales charts making it a clear competitor to Sony. The Switch had been the most sold console for 33 months up until the PS5 took the spot in September (Tassi 2021). However, the internal power of the Nintendo Switch does not match up with the internal power of the PS5. The PS5 can run games at a native 4K resolution whereas the Nintendo Switch can run those games at a resolution of either 1080p or 720p. There is a clear gap in the power of these consoles.  
Sony Pictures is positioned well in the movie industry. It released Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse in 2018 and garnered a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes with an audience score of 93%. With the upcoming release of Spider-Man: No Way Home, which is sure to be big at the box office, Sony Pictures has great projects coming up. Disney is most definitely the biggest competitor Sony Pictures has. Disney has the rights to make Marvel, and Star Wars movies. These two franchises bring a lot of popularity among nerd culture. Disney has been on fire with its Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The fact that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse can do very well without the help from Disney by being related to the MCU shows that Sony Pictures can put up a fight in the movie industry. 
Sony TVs are some of the best televisions to buy. TechRadar, a website dedicated to buying guides for technology, put Sony’s A90J OLED TV in the top ten of TVs to buy for 2021. Sony’s televisions always seem to be highly regarded for their picture quality only downside is their price. Samsung is one of Sony’s biggest competitors in TV manufacturing. Samsung TVs are often on top ten TV charts together with Sony TVs and are looked at as quality TVs. However, in most rankings, Sony TVs chart higher than Samsung TVs. Sony TVs internal machinery are always being improved upon and are often highly regarded. They have the possibility to continue being one of the top TVs money can buy.
