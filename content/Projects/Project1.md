#### Background 
Since the creation of the internet, video games have evolved into social phenomena. From playing online on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) with the network adapter to playing on a PC, people have been gaming online for years now. During the seventh generation of video game consoles, the Xbox 360, created by Microsoft, became one of the first consoles to offer a subscription based online service, Xbox Live Gold. Microsoft first released Xbox Live, now named Xbox Network, on the original Xbox back in 2002 but did not charge for online play until the release of its successor (“Xbox Network”, 2021). Sony combated Xbox Live by creating the PlayStation Network (PSN), which became available for the PlayStation 3 (PS3) in 2006. PlayStation did not charge for the use of online play when it initially released. It was not until the release of the PlayStation 4 (PS4) where it began charging for online gameplay under the subscription service PlayStation Plus (PS Plus). PS Plus initially launched on the PS3 on June 29, 2010 offering PlayStation Store discounts and free monthly games (“PlayStation Network”, 2021). With the launch of the PS4, it continued to offer the discounts and free games. Even today, PlayStation Plus continues to grow its offers by adding the PS Plus collection for the release of their new console, the PlayStation 5 (PS5). The advancement of cloud technology brought new ways to play. Sony acquired Gaikai, an American company which provides technology for the streaming of high-end video games, in 2012 (“Gaikai”, 2021). This acquisition led to the creation of two new key features available for PlayStation users, PlayStation Now (PS Now) and Remote Play. PS Now offers PS4, PS5, and PC users the ability to stream PS2, PS3, and PS4 games. PS4 and PS5 users are only able to download PS2 and PS4 games (“PlayStation Now”, 2021). In 2017, Microsoft came out with its competitor to PS Now, a video game subscription service called Xbox Game Pass (Game Pass) (Warren, 2021). Game Pass comes with a catalog of over 300 games that are downloadable on Xbox systems or PC (Henderson, 2021). The games range from the original Xbox to their new flagship consoles, the Xbox Series X and S. One can see that the future of playing video games is heading towards subscription based services.  

#### The Problem with PlayStation Now 
Even though PS Now was one of the pioneers into the streaming of video games, their 
initial approach to it came with some errors. Sony priced PS Now at $20 per month making it 
twice as expensive as PS Plus. There were very little early adopters, which led to a stagnant 
launch. With video games being a niche market, having a high barrier to entry plateaued the 
subscription base for PS Now. To this day, PS Now has only about 2.2 million subscribers, far 
less than its competitors (Ivan, 2020). This low number can only be attributed to the wrong 
pricing model they offered at launch. It was clear that the price needed to be changed. In 2019, 
they lowered the price of PS Now to $10 per month to combat the growing popularity of Game 
Pass (Shepherd, 2021). However, even with the lowered price, the growth of subscribers is still 
low and PS Now’s popularity is waning. Pricing is not the only problem it has. PS Now is mainly 
marketed as a streaming service. Streaming is not completely feasible in most places in the US. 
There are many places in the US that do not have the bandwidth capabilities to stream PS Now. 
Having the option of downloading all of the games they offer is an alternative they should be 
considering. As mentioned earlier, one can only download PS2 and PS4 games. PS3 games are 
not downloadable, making the service not worth it for those who have slow internet. With the 
issues that have been stated for PS Now, the question that Sony needs to ask itself is what can 
they do to increase the number of PlayStation Now subscribers?

#### The Perfect Bundle
The best answer to that question is bundling the PlayStation’s subscription services, 
PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now. If they create a pricing strategy where the bundle costs 
$120 per year, there will be no loss of profit and the price will be lower than most of its 
competitors for this premium subscription. If they charge $15 per month, there would not an 
initial loss because both services individually cost $10 per month. However, Xbox Game Pass 
offers three versions, and of the three, the main version that the new PlayStation bundle will 
combat is Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. With the success of Game Pass Ultimate and its price point 
at $15 per month, one can see the consumer’s willingness to pay for a bundled service is $15 per 
month. Sony would benefit more to have their monthly price point at $15 per month. In this 
pricing strategy, it would be five dollars less each month than if they were paying for both PS 
Plus and PS Now independently since both charge $10 a month. With PS Plus having a 
stronghold in the PlayStation community, bundling it with PS Now can give it the recognition it 
needs to grow. Liam Croft from news media, Push Square, notes “there are now 47.4 million 
active PS Plus members, representing an increase of 8.6 million compared to the same time last 
year” (2021). One can see that the number of subscribers for PS Plus will only continue to grow 
as more consoles are sold. With these 47.4 million PS Plus members, giving them to upgrade 
their service for another $5 a month can entice them to subscribe to the bundle.  

Those who subscribe to the bundle will get the benefits of both subscription services. 
Those who are subscribed to PS Now are now able to play online and have access to PS Plus 
discounts in the PS Store. Those who are subscribed to the PS Plus get the benefit of playing 
games that have been locked into old systems. Consumers who only have one console will be 
able to play about almost anything from previous generations to the games they currently have.
With the combination of PS Plus and PS Now, they have the chance to play all the nostalgia that 
they could ever want while playing the newest games as well. There has already been talk about 
the discontinuation of the PS3 store, so subscribing to PS Now will be the only way to play PS3 
games digitally if you do not own a PS3. Bundling the products is a plus (pun intended) for both 
subscription services, but Sony should also consider how the bundle will fare against the 
competition. 

#### PlayStation Bundle VS Xbox Game Pass Ultimate
The main competitor to PlayStation Now is the one that was created to combat it, Xbox 
Game Pass. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the most popular game subscription service in the 
market. Ultimate is the bundled offering of Xbox Game Pass, Game Pass for PC, and Xbox Live 
Gold, which allows Game Pass owners to play online multiplayer games. Game Pass includes 
new releases that are available day one. For example, Outriders, a game developed by People 
Can Fly and published by Square Enix, released day one on Game Pass on April 1, 2021 (Palm, 
2021). Outriders had a successful launch because of the player base it generated just by being 
offered through Game Pass. It is clear that Game Pass has its perks and people are aware of this. 
As noted by website Eurogamer, “Microsoft has announced a new total of 18 million monthly 
subscribers to Xbox Game Pass” (Phillips, 2021). This staggering subscription base is 16 million 
more than those who subscribe to PS Now making it the clear competitor.  
However, PlayStation still has the ability to bounce back. With the bundled services, 
PlayStation can match all the perks that come with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and for a lesser 
price, when priced yearly. Business Insider notes, “at $15 per month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 
costs $180 per year,” (Webb, 2021). The consumer’s willingness to pay is $180 per year for a 
bundled package like Game Pass Ultimate. If PlayStation prices the bundle at $120 per year (PS 
Plus at $60 and PS Now at $60), it would be clear that, for the lesser price, people would be
getting more. All the benefits that come with the new bundle greatly outweigh the benefits of 
Game Pass. If Game Pass has seen success with its current pricing model, there should be 
success with the new bundle. 

#### Conclusion
Bundling their subscriptions services is the best move Sony can make to continue to 
compete in the video game subscription service market. It is clear that the benefits will outweigh 
the cost of bundling, which is essentially nonexistent. Game Pass has been a huge success for 
Xbox and having a service that will truly combat it will raise awareness. PlayStation Now has an 
opportunity to grow and be just as good as Game Pass. It is on Sony to make the right decision
